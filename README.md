**Hello World! Nice to see you hereðŸ‘‹**

## My Professional Journey
My professional journey began as a mechanical engineer in the field of industrial automation and robotics. This role was an exhilarating experience for me as a novice engineer, where I could blend my creativity with my engineering skills to innovate and develop automated equipment. I had the opportunity to simulate these devices, oversee their manufacturing and assembly, and ultimately witness them in operation at the manufacturing site.

Whenever a new project was announced, I found myself excited about a new challenge. I was eager to find solutions, and I was confident in my ability to do so. While grappling with these challenges could become draining over time, my tenacity would ultimately lead to a resolution.

However, a few years ago, I decided to embark on a new challenge by exploring a different field: data science and artificial intelligence. I enrolled in a masterâ€™s program to learn about statistics, data operations, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Currently, Iâ€™m seeking opportunities to apply my newly acquired knowledge to real-world problems, hoping to leverage my valuable experience from my previous role.
